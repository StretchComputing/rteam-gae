          <li>
            No, definitely not!<br><br>
            The coach or team coordinator currently needs to have an iPhone to create the team and get the ball rolling.<br><br>
            Members can participate in a number of ways including: the rTeam app, email, text messaging or Twitter.

            Currently, rTeam is a free download from the iTunes App Store. rTeam does display <div style="display: inline;"><a href="http://advertising.apple.com">iAds</a></div> as a source of revenue.<br><br>
            In the future, we may provide an option for users to buy out of the ads if they so choose.

      <li>What does 'powered by the cloud' mean?
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you haven't heard this term before, you will start hearing it more.<br><br>
            Cloud computing is what powers all internet services today, like: Google, Amazon, etc.<br><br>
            What it means to our users is that rTeam is not a single user app that simply runs on the phone. Rather, it is a multi-user app that makes information available to everyone, instantly.<br><br>
            For example, if one user updates a game score on their phone, that score is available to all team members and fans right away.
