Web Appliance

I once wrote, the Page is King (LINK).  I was referring to web pages for they exemmplify the full utility and power of the web. Nothing has changed; for
like the universe the web continues to expand in every possible direction.  But all the buzz today is about mobile and the smart phones that give us instant access 
to everything we need. Apple and Google are changing our lives. So in all this innovation and change, where does the web fit in?

Back to the universe analogy, noting happens outside of the web. The web assimilates all things including mobile. In the mobile buzz, there is a lot of talk
about the most popular apps of the I have a sneaking suspicion that the most popular mobile app is almost certainly the browser.
